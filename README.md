# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Timer is a simple Python application built using the tkinter library. It helps you improve your productivity by following the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- Adjustable work intervals (default: 25 minutes).
- Customizable short break intervals (default: 5 minutes).
- Long break intervals after completing a set number of work intervals (default: 20 minutes after 4 work intervals).
- Automatic cycling between work and break intervals.
- Session tracking with cute chicken emojis üêì to motivate you.
